Flutter Project for Mobile App Assessment from Evermos

## Tech Stack Used

I tried to implement the Clean Architecture pattern using Provider as the State Management. Some of the tech stacks used are as following:
- Dio for networking
- Provider for State Management
- Clean Architecture as the design/architectural pattern
- Connectivity for Network status
- GetIt for Dependency Injection

Note: I tried to implement caching and testing but I didn't had enough time.

Thank you for checking out!
